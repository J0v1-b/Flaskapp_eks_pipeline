# EKS Automation

## Welcome to my EKS Automation repository!

This repository contains a collection of scripts and templates that automate the process of creating and managing an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster, deploying a flask app.

The files in this repository can be used to quickly and easily spin up a new EKS cluster, and also includes a set of templates for deploying common Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, Services, and Ingress.

The scripts and templates are designed to be easily customizable, so that you can tailor them to your specific needs.

To get started, you will need to have an AWS account, and have the AWS CLI and kubectl installed on your local machine. Once you have those set up, you can use the provided scripts to create a new EKS cluster, and then use the templates to deploy your Kubernetes resources.
